## homebrew "smart"watch with BLE radio

Project status: all bugs not fixed before January 1st 2020 are now features

# Hi!
I am Eric Min and I'm a 18 year old teenager from Seoul, South Korea. This is my first steps into circuit design, the ARM architecture, and firmware development. It is a wristwatch leveraging the low-power and BLE features of Nordic's nRF52832. I think it looks pretty dope! :)

# THE JUICY STUFF:
-   PROCESSOR: nRF52832 Soc. 64MHz ARM cortex M4 with 64k RAM and 512k flash.
-   FIRMWARE: Espruino Javascript interpreter.
-   POWER: 12mm coin-cell battery. About a week of battery life.
-   DISPLAY: If you can call it a display. Dual 7-segment LEDs with five auxiliary LEDs.
-   INPUT: Triple momentary tactile switches.
-   SOUND: Mini piezo speaker.
-   DIMENSIONS: 43.18mm width and length, 10.2mm thickness.
-   STRAP: 22mm NATO strap.
